## Projects:

### Generative Chatbot
[Github repo](https://github.com/alexfioto/Seinfeld-Chatbot)

This project explores the current state of text generation utilizing GPT2 and aitextgen. I created an interactive chatbot trained on dialogue from the hit sitcom, Seinfeld, to create an entertaining and functional AI. Given a prompt, this AI produces coherent and believable Seinfeld-esque dialogue.

Additionally, the chatbot has a built in character predictor. Given a person's chat dialogue, the bot will predict which main character you sound most like. Lastly, the chatbot will recommend episodes based on how you interact. Based on transfer-learned sentence level embeddings, it calculates which episodes "sound" most like you. Each recommendation provides an option to hear the plot and a direct link to watch the show. Below is a demonstration.

### Decoding Covid
Team Project 
[Github repo](https://github.com/alexfioto/Decoding-COVID)

Using data collected by the New York Times, this project aims to explore the spread of COVID-19 in regards to mask sentiment and predict daily case "regime" changes using a unsupervised Hidden Markov model. My team developed a suite of applications that help visualize the spread of COVID-19 and plot daily case change along with predicted "regime" change. The hope is that a user can check the website to see if we have entered a new "phase" of virus spread as well as plot potential Super Spreader events to compare timelines.- A mobile app which allows users to input ingredients and provides cocktail recipes based on ingredients at hand through database communication.

### Reddit Classifier
[Github repo](https://github.com/alexfioto/reddit-classification)

Utilizing Reddit's API, I scraped over 30,000 posts from the "Maching Learning" and "Artificial Intelligence" sub-Reddits. Using advanced NLP techniques and various classification models from scikit-learn, I was able to predict with 85% accuracy which sub-Reddit a post came from using a Random Forest Classifier. Recently, I have updated my project with Tensorflow's most current NLP classification framework.
